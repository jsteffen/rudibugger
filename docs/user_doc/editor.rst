Editor
======

**rudibugger** has an integrated editor based on *RichTextFX*. (For more information about this dependency, take a look at its `github page <https://github.com/FXMisc/RichTextFX/>`_.

It is also possible to use an external editor. Right now, a well working *Emacs* integration is implemented. It can be activated under :menuselection:`Tools --> Options --> Default editor`. At the same place, you can also set up your own editor. Cf. section :ref:`Settings<Settings>` for more information.
